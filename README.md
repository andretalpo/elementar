Elementar is an application to help people to check if the new on the web are truthy or fake.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thanks our teacher, TAs, all ironhack staff and our classmates for the support.

## Prerequisites

No hardware prerequisites and no instalation needed. This aplication works 100% online and can be accessed in any device (100% responsive!).

## How to navigate

This app is very intuitive and easy to navigate. At the home page it`s possible to search a news through it's url (even if you are not logged in).
If you log in the siystem, it's possible to search news and vote if it's fake or not.


## Additional implementations and improvements

Althouth the app is fully functional, improvements can be made to increase user's experience:

* Add an API to improve the confiability of the evaluation
* Implement a search method using text (instead of only url)
